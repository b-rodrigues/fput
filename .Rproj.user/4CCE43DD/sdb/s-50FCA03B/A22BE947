This book is not an in-depth guide to functional programming, nor unit testing with R.\nThere are better resources to learn \n[functional progamming](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Functional-programming.html) and \n[unit testing](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/tests.html) with R. But I will introduce the main ideas. I\nwill also show how to build your own R package that will hold all the code to clean your data and \naccompagnying documentation. Again, there are [great resources online](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/) \nto learn about packages. I will just cover the basics, and explain why having your code inside a \npackages makes sense when using functional programming and unit tests with R.\n\nThis book is not an introduction to R either. I will assume that you have intermediate knowledge of R.\n\n## Motivation\n\nFunctional programming has very nice features that make working on data sets much more pleasant. It is \ncommon that you have to repeat the same instructions over and over again for different data sets that\nlook very similar (for example, same, or similar column names). Of course, it is possible to loop\nover these data sets and repeat a set of instructions that change these data sets. However, we will see\nwhy a functional programming approach is to be preferred. \n\nUnit testing then allows you to make sure that the functions you want to apply to your data sets actually\ndo what you really want them to do. Knowing and applying these two concepts together will make you \nhopefully a better data analyst. \n\n## Who am I?\n\nI use R daily at my current job, and discovered R some years ago while I was at the \n[University of Strasbourg](http://www.unistra.fr/index.php?id=accueil). I'm not an R developer, and don't\nhave a CS background. Most, if not everything, that I know about R is self-taught. I hope however\nthat you will find this book useful. You can [follow me on twitter](https://twitter.com/brodriguesco)\nor check [my blog](http://t.co/Hd94HCx0Wf).\n\n## Thanks\n\nI'd like to thank [Ross Ihaka](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~ihaka/) and [Robert Gentleman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Gentleman_(statistician)) for developing the R \nprogramming language. Many thanks to [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/) for all the wonderful\npackages he developed that make R much more pleasant to use. Thanks to [Yihui Yie](http://yihui.name/)\nfor `bookdown` without which this book would not exist (at least not in this very nice format). \n\nThanks to [Hans-Martin von Gaudecker](https://www.iame.uni-bonn.de/people/hm-gaudecker) for \nintroducing me to unit testing and writing elegant code. The PEP 8 style guidelines will forever \nremain etched in my brain.\n\nFinally I have to thank my wife for putting up with my endless rants against people not using \nfunctional programming nor testing their code (or worse, using proprietary software!). \n",
